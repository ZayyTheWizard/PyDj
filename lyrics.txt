Huh? (These niggas know me for real)
What? (For real)
Von
Rob who? Take what? You tweakin' (you tweakin')
I said it was war, lil' nigga, I mean it
I done got off the floor, who got shot? I don't know
Headshots up close, lil' nigga, I seent it
Gun got dirty, lil' nigga, I cleaned it (I cleaned it)
.45 Glock on the bottom where the beam is (where the beam is)
If a nigga move foul then we aimin' where his team is
Said ya lil' niggas down, motherfucker, you ain't mean it
Get caught, just stick to the code (uh-huh)
Got some niggas locked up and they know what they know
My homie lost trial, he'll be gone for a while
If he give up me then he lettin' 'em go (damn)
He won't be back on the streets 'til he old
Everyone that he love, they gon' be gone
I know some niggas that's quick to give a police a tip (uh, why?)
But my nigga, he never folded
I don't really give a fuck what the block said
Too official to clear up a rumor
My homie laugh hard, heard an opp was dead
Guess he got a killer sense of humor
I heard that pussy been thinkin' 'bout death
Well that bullet gon' stick to his mind like a tumor (uh)
Catch him and change him, look how they played him (uh-huh)
He only gangster up on his computer (damn)
He play foul and we gave him a pass
That don't mean we won't get on your ass in the future
And I won't trip when my lil' brother clutchin'
Know how he put in that work with that Ruger (grrah-rrah)
My sneakers Louboutin, these ain't Puma's
I got a low end ho, she a booster
Nut on her face and I call her an Uber
He savin' these hoes like his first name was Super
Now it's time to ride, is you ready or what?
Caught a few homicides now they ain't lettin' up
Thirteen hundred shots when we ride in them trucks (yeah)
Get on any side and we fuckin' you up
I used to trap with the gangsters and clucks
Straight in the slums where they prayin' for luck
Like I'm Giannis, I play for them bucks
Hood on my back and I came in the clutch
Rob who? Take what? You tweakin' (Von)
I said it was war, lil' nigga, I mean it
I done got out the floor, who got shot? I don't know (boom)
Headshots up close, lil' nigga, I seent it
Gun got dirty, lil' nigga, I cleaned it (yeah)
.45 Glock on the bottom where the beam is (uh-huh)
If a nigga move foul then we aimin' where his team is
Said ya lil' niggas down, motherfucker, you ain't mean it

My homie lost trial, he'll be gone for a while
If he give up me then he lettin' 'em go (damn)
He won't be back on the streets 'til he old
Everyone that he love, they gon' be gone (uh-uh, huh?)
I know some niggas that's quick to give a police a tip
But my nigga, he never folded
I got my first hundred thou' when I broke it down
With my team, boy, I am so goated
I always stuck out in the crowd when I was a child
I was special and my mama noticed (they knew it)
That nigga cool, but Von, he the coldest
I live my life like a book and I wrote it (uh-huh)
I drop a song and these niggas quote it (uh-huh)
If he lookin' for me, I'm probably where his ho is (yeah)
Only fuck bitches that's bad, ain't got no kids (yeah)
I'm goin' crazy like I ain't got no sense (yeah, yeah)
You in that car and that bitch ain't got no tint (huh?)
We pullin' up and we lettin' off four knicks (grrah, grrah)
Don't need cap credit we givin' out facelifts
He breathin' hard, don't think he gon' make it (boom, boom)
I chopped the block up and ain't have my face mask (boom, boom)
So I'ma stay in, that's how my day end (boom, boom)
Say he a heavy, we see at the weigh in (we'll see)
He want a song or a verse, gotta pay then (yeah)
Don't see me stoppin', don't know where my breaks is (nah)
Only want blues, man, I'm startin' to get racist
Shit be gettin' real in that field and them chases (Von)
Can't go back now, I got too many cases (skrrt, skrrt)
You don't look for me and see too many faces (nah)
Nigga, you in the way, and bitch, I'm your replacement (boom, boom)
Rob who? Take what? You tweakin'
